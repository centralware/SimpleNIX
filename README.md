## Features

We aim to build a complete, automated and networked build system from the kernel to the desktop


- [X] Phase 1: Gather as many source packages and build scripts/notes as we can find starting with our current extension history
- [ ] Phase 2: Create build scripts from a modular template for each library/application (More than 16,800!)
- [ ] Phase 3: Create a hardware network of ARM, RISC and/or x86/64 for testing and running new build scripts
- [ ] Phase 4: Reach out to software authors, OS distros, etc. looking for interest and extra hands*
- [ ] Phase 5: Create a peer2peer network of ARM and x86/64 hardware for global compiling and hardware testing!

* The final product of this project, in theory, could be used for virtually any flavor of 'Nix
